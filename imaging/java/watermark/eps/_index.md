 Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images with in applications. Aspose.Imaging is a fast API for Image processing, including but not limited to image conversions and manipulations such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, image transformations, export and conversion to multiple formats. Its a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high performance image conversion feature with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on premise APIs and files are processed at your own servers.

```cs

// Load image
Image image = Image.load("image.eps");

// Create and initialize an instance of Graphics class
Graphics graphics= new Graphics(image);

// Creates an instance of Font
Font font = new Font("Times New Roman", 16, FontStyle.Bold);

// Create an instance of SolidBrush and set its properties
SolidBrush brush = new SolidBrush();
brush.setColor(Color.getBlack());
brush.setOpacity(100);

// Draw a string using the SolidBrush and Font objects at specific point
graphics.drawString("Watermark by Aspose.Imaging for Java", font, brush, new PointF(image.getWidth()-100, image.getHeight()-100));

// Save image
image.save("watermarked-image.eps");

FIles with EPS extension essentially describe an Encapsulated PostScript language program that describes the appearance of a single page. The name "Encapsulated" because it can be included or encapsulated in another PostScript language page description. This script based file format may contain any combination of text, graphics and images. EPS files may include a bitmap preview image encapsulated inside for display by applications that can open such files. EPS files can be converted to standard image formats such as JPG, PNG, TIFF and PDF using different applications e.g. Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and PaintShop Pro. Because of a security vulnerability in EPS files, Office 2016, Office 2013, Office 2010, and Office 365 have turned off the ability to insert EPS files into Office documents.
