 Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images with in applications. Aspose.Imaging is a fast API for Image processing, including but not limited to image conversions and manipulations such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, image transformations, export and conversion to multiple formats. Its a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high performance image conversion feature with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on premise APIs and files are processed at your own servers.

```cs

// Load image
Image image = Image.load("image.dicom");

// Create and initialize an instance of Graphics class
Graphics graphics= new Graphics(image);

// Creates an instance of Font
Font font = new Font("Times New Roman", 16, FontStyle.Bold);

// Create an instance of SolidBrush and set its properties
SolidBrush brush = new SolidBrush();
brush.setColor(Color.getBlack());
brush.setOpacity(100);

// Draw a string using the SolidBrush and Font objects at specific point
graphics.drawString("Watermark by Aspose.Imaging for Java", font, brush, new PointF(image.getWidth()-100, image.getHeight()-100));

// Save image
image.save("watermarked-image.dicom");

DICOM is the acronym for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine and pertains to the field of Medical Informatics. DICOM is the combination of file format definition and a network communications protocol. DICOM uses the .DCM extension. .DCM exist in two different formats i.e. format 1.x and format 2.x. DCM Format 1.x is further available in two versions normal and extended. DICOM is used for the integration of medical imaging devices like printers, servers, scanners etc from various vendors and also contains identification data of each patient for uniqueness. DICOM files can be shared between two parties if they are capable of receiving image data in DICOM format. The communication part of DICOM is application layer protocol and uses TCP/IP to communicate between entities. HTTP and HTTPS protocols are used for the web services of DICOM. Versions supported by web services are 1.0, 1.1, 2 or later.
