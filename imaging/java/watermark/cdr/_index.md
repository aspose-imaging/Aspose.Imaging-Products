 Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images with in applications. Aspose.Imaging is a fast API for Image processing, including but not limited to image conversions and manipulations such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, image transformations, export and conversion to multiple formats. Its a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high performance image conversion feature with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on premise APIs and files are processed at your own servers.

// Creates an instance of Font
Font font = new Font("Times New Roman", 16, FontStyle.Bold);

// Create an instance of SolidBrush and set its properties
SolidBrush brush = new SolidBrush();
brush.setColor(Color.getBlack());
brush.setOpacity(100);

// Draw a string using the SolidBrush and Font objects at specific point
graphics.drawString("Watermark by Aspose.Imaging for Java", font, brush, new PointF(image.getWidth()-100, image.getHeight()-100));

A CDR file is a vector drawing image file that is natively created with CorelDRAW for storing digital image encoded and compressed. Such a drawing file contains text, lines, shapes, images, colours and effects for vector representation of image contents. CDR files can be opened with CorelDRAW as the primary application and can also be converted to other formats such as PDF, JPG, PNG, BMP and AI. It can be used for representation of various graphics data like brochures, tabloids, envelopes, and postcards. Besides CorelDRAW, other Corel products such as Corel Paintshop Pro and CorelDRAW Graphics suite can also open the CDR file formats.
