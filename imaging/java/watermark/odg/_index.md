 Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images with in applications. Aspose.Imaging is a fast API for Image processing, including but not limited to image conversions and manipulations such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, image transformations, export and conversion to multiple formats. Its a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high performance image conversion feature with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on premise APIs and files are processed at your own servers.

```cs

// Load image
Image image = Image.load("image.odg");

// Create and initialize an instance of Graphics class
Graphics graphics= new Graphics(image);

// Creates an instance of Font
Font font = new Font("Times New Roman", 16, FontStyle.Bold);

// Create an instance of SolidBrush and set its properties
SolidBrush brush = new SolidBrush();
brush.setColor(Color.getBlack());
brush.setOpacity(100);

// Draw a string using the SolidBrush and Font objects at specific point
graphics.drawString("Watermark by Aspose.Imaging for Java", font, brush, new PointF(image.getWidth()-100, image.getHeight()-100));

// Save image
image.save("watermarked-image.odg");

The ODG file format is used by Apache OpenOffice's Draw application to store drawing elements as a vector image. It follows the XML based file format specifications outlined by Advancement of Structural Information Standards (OASIS). ODG represents drawings as vector images using points, lines and curves. Besides OpenOffice, LibreOffice and other applications also provide support for working with ODG file format. Other formats supported by OpenOffice, for example, include ODT, ODF, ODP and ODS.
