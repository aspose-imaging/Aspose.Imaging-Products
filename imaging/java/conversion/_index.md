For any advance image processing application, Java Image API facilitates the developers to create, load, manipulate or render images without any image editor requirement. It can convert vector & raster images, including photos and pictures to PSD, PDF, GIF, PNG, DICOM, DXF, SVG, JPG, JPEG2000, APNG, BMP, TIFF, HTML5 CANVAS, WMF, EMF, WEBP and other image formats. API provides binarization and grayscaling method to convert images to black n white and grayscale as well as convert open document graphics, RGB color system to CMYK and more.

Using Java Image API, Inter conversion is simple and developers have to write just few coding lines for any case including  **image to jpg**, **image to bmp**, **image to png** etc. API provides [Image.load](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/Image#load-java.lang.String-) to load the images. Specify relevant image options from the [ImageOptionsBase](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/ImageOptionsBase) and call the save method with output image file and options as parameters.

Process of converting raster images to PSD is same as of inter conversion of images, except that API provides [PsdOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions/PsdOptions) for specific PSD settings. Programmers can easily enhance it for their specific needs.

Conversion process of CDR is almost same, Load CDR file, Use relevant image saving options and calling the Save method. Image API provides [VectorRasterizationOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions/vectorrasterizationoptions) for setting required parameters. And these rasterization Options can be assinged the required image options for their settings. Fianlly call the save method.
