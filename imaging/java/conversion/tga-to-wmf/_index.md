 In order to render TGA to WMF, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Imaging for Java](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-imaging) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Aspose.Imaging API makes it easy for the developers to convert TGA file to WMF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load TGA file with Image.load method
1. Create & set an instance of WmfOptions
1. Call Image.save method
1. Pass file path with WMF extension & object of WmfOptions as parameters

 Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images with in applications. Aspose.Imaging is a fast API for Image processing, including but not limited to image conversions and manipulations such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, image transformations, export and conversion to multiple formats. Its a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high performance image conversion feature with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on premise APIs and files are processed at your own servers. ‎

A file with .tga extension is a raster graphic format and was created by Truevision Inc. It was designed for the TARGA (Truevision Advanced Raster Adapter) boards and provided Highcolor/truecolor display support for IBM-compatible PCs. It supports 8, 16, 24 and 32 bits per pixel and 8-bit alpha channel. It also supports lossless RLE compression that can be applied to reduce the image size. Digital photos and textures use the TGA image format.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="WMF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/wmf/" >}}

Files with WMF extension represent Microsoft Windows Metafile (WMF) for storing vector as well as bitmap-format images data. To be more accurate, WMF belongs to the vector file format category of Graphics file formats that is device independent. Windows Graphical Device Interface (GDI) uses the functions stored in a WMF file to display an image on the screen. A more enhanced version of WMF, known as Enhanced Meta Files (EMF), was published later that makes the format more feature rich. Practically, WMF are similar to SVG.
