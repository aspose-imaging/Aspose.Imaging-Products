In order to convert DNG to EMZ, we’ll use
[Aspose.Imaging for Java](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/java) 
API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
[Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-imaging) 
and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

Developers can easily load & convert DNG files to EMZ in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Load DNG file with Image.load method
+ Create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.)
+ Call the Image.save method
+ Pass file path with EMZ extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class

Before running the conversion example code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- JDK 1.6 or higher is installed.

Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

DNG is a digital camera image format used for the storage of raw files. It has been developed by Adobe in September 2004. It was basically developed for digital photography. DNG is an extension of TIFF/EP standard format and uses metadata significantly. In order to manipulate raw data from digital cameras with ease of flexibility and artistic control, photographers opt camera raw files. JPEG and TIFF formats store images that are processed by the camera, therefore not much room for alteration is available in such formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="EMZ" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/emz" >}}
A file with the EMZ file extension is a compressed image file, more specifically referred to as a Windows Compressed Enhanced Metafile file
