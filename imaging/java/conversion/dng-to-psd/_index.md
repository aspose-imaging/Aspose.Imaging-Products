 Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images with in applications. Aspose.Imaging is a fast API for Image processing, including but not limited to image conversions and manipulations such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, image transformations, export and conversion to multiple formats. Its a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high performance image conversion feature with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on premise APIs and files are processed at your own servers. ‎

DNG is a digital camera image format used for the storage of raw files. It has been developed by Adobe in September 2004. It was basically developed for digital photography. DNG is an extension of TIFF/EP standard format and uses metadata significantly. In order to manipulate raw data from digital cameras with ease of flexibility and artistic control, photographers opt camera raw files. JPEG and TIFF formats store images that are processed by the camera, therefore not much room for alteration is available in such formats.

PSD, Photoshop Document, represents Adobe Photoshop's native file format used for graphics designing and development. PSD files may include image layers, adjustment layers, layer masks, annotations, file information, keywords and other Photoshop-specific elements. Photoshop files have default extension as .PSD and has a maximum height and width of 30,000 pixels, and a length limit of two gigabytes.
