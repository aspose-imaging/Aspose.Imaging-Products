Frequently, achieving the ideal image requires changing the background. To attain the desired ODG format image effect, foreground objects must be isolated from the rest of the picture. Automatic object detection is possible if the background is uniform. If the photo's background is uneven or object separation is challenging, pre-marking the image is recommended. This involves identifying rectangular regions within the photo where intended objects reside and specifying their types. This can be done manually or automatically through the Cloud API's object recognition feature. Following object selection and original background removal, a new background can be applied or transparency can be implemented. In order to change background in ODG files, we'll use [Aspose.Imaging for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.imaging) package manager, search for
 **Aspose.Imaging** and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Imaging for .NET API" %}}


Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

The ODG file format is used by Apache OpenOffice's Draw application to store drawing elements as a vector image. It follows the XML based file format specifications outlined by Advancement of Structural Information Standards (OASIS). ODG represents drawings as vector images using points, lines and curves. Besides OpenOffice, LibreOffice and other applications also provide support for working with ODG file format. Other formats supported by OpenOffice, for example, include ODT, ODF, ODP and ODS.
