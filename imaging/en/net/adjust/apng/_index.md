    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Imaging for .NET API" %}}


Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

A file with .apng (Animated Portable Network Graphics) extension is a raster graphic format and is an unofficial extension to the Portable Network Graphic (PNG ). It comprises of multiple frames (each of PNG image) that represents an animation sequence. This gives similar visualization as a GIF file. APNG files support 24-bit images and 8-bit transparency. APNG is backward compatible with non-animated GIF files. APNG files use the same .png extension and can be opened by applications such as Mozilla Firefox, Chrome with APNG support, iMessage apps for iOS 10.
