In order to grayscale J2K files, we’ll use [Aspose.Imaging for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.imaging) package manager, search for
 **Aspose.Imaging** and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

+  Load J2K files with Image.Load method
+  Grayscale images;
+  Save compressed image to disc in the supported by Aspose.Imaging format

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Imaging for .NET API" %}}


Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.
