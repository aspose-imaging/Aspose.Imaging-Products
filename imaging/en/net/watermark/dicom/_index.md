A watermark is an essential tool for authors seeking maximum exposure for their work on the internet. Placing a watermark on an image serves not only to identify its source or copyright holder but also to promote its creator. This is because the signature containing the author's name or the internet resource's name is distributed alongside a digital copy of the image. Watermarks can take the form of text with a wide range of fonts and can be positioned at the image's edge. When the watermark is transparent, it doesn't disrupt viewing. However, if the author or copyright holder wishes to emphasize their name, the watermark may partially overlap the image. In order to watermark DICOM image file, we'll use [Aspose.Imaging for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.imaging) package manager, search for
 **Aspose.Imaging** and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

You need the [aspose.imaging.dll](https://downloads.aspose.com/imaging/net) to try the following workflow in your own environment.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ load DICOM file with Image.Load method;
+ create instance of Graphics from the Image;
+ define Font, Brush and Format for watermark text;
+ draw watermark using Graphics.DrawString method;
+ save image to disc in DICOM format.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Imaging for .NET API" %}}


Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

DICOM is the acronym for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine and pertains to the field of Medical Informatics. DICOM is the combination of file format definition and a network communications protocol. DICOM uses the .DCM extension. .DCM exist in two different formats i.e. format 1.x and format 2.x. DCM Format 1.x is further available in two versions normal and extended. DICOM is used for the integration of medical imaging devices like printers, servers, scanners etc from various vendors and also contains identification data of each patient for uniqueness. DICOM files can be shared between two parties if they are capable of receiving image data in DICOM format. The communication part of DICOM is application layer protocol and uses TCP/IP to communicate between entities. HTTP and HTTPS protocols are used for the web services of DICOM. Versions supported by web services are 1.0, 1.1, 2 or later.
