{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="How to View ODG images Using C#" %}}

We often receive images in less common formats as source materials. For subsequent viewing of such images, special programs are required. In order not to think about this problem and use the time to solve the issue for more creative tasks, use the functions of the C# graphic library. By converting such images to files of more popular formats, you can open them in the standard image viewing program for your platform. In order to view ODG files, we'll use [Aspose.Imaging for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.imaging) package manager, search for
 **Aspose.Imaging** and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

You need the [aspose.imaging.dll](https://downloads.aspose.com/imaging/net) to try the following workflow in your own environment.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ load ODG files with Image.Load method;
+ create image view;
+ save new image to disc in the supported by Aspose.Imaging format.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Imaging for .NET API" %}}


Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="ODG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/odg/" whatIsFormat1="What is" whatIsFormat2="File Format" readMoreFormat="Read More" >}}
The ODG file format is used by Apache OpenOffice's Draw application to store drawing elements as a vector image. It follows the XML based file format specifications outlined by Advancement of Structural Information Standards (OASIS). ODG represents drawings as vector images using points, lines and curves. Besides OpenOffice, LibreOffice and other applications also provide support for working with ODG file format. Other formats supported by OpenOffice, for example, include ODT, ODF, ODP and ODS.
