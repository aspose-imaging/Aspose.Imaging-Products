Converting file formats may seem like a routine task encountered by graphic designers. Yet, underestimating its significance would be a mistake. The evaluation of your work might depend on how swiftly and effectively you tackle this task. Typically, original images need conversion into formats better suited for printing or online publication. If the original image originates from a graphic editor, it might be in vector format. In this scenario, it must be rasterized and converted to a raster format for publishing purposes. You have the choice to save the image in an uncompressed format for optimal quality or convert it to a lossless compressed format to reduce file size. In certain contexts, like web publishing, you can opt for lossy compressed formats. Specially designed algorithms for image data compression permit a significant reduction in file size while preserving acceptable image quality. This facilitates fast image file downloads from the internet. In order to convert CDR to WMZ, we'll use [Aspose.Imaging for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.imaging) package manager, search for
 **Aspose.Imaging** and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

Developers can easily load & convert CDR files to WMZ in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ load CDR file with Image.Load method;
+ create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.);
+ call the Image.Save method;
+ pass file path with WMZ extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class.

A CDR file is a vector drawing image file that is natively created with CorelDRAW for storing digital image encoded and compressed. Such a drawing file contains text, lines, shapes, images, colours and effects for vector representation of image contents. CDR files can be opened with CorelDRAW as the primary application and can also be converted to other formats such as PDF, JPG, PNG, BMP and AI. It can be used for representation of various graphics data like brochures, tabloids, envelopes, and postcards. Besides CorelDRAW, other Corel products such as Corel Paintshop Pro and CorelDRAW Graphics suite can also open the CDR file formats.
