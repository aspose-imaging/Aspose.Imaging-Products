Converting file formats may seem like a routine task encountered by graphic designers. Yet, underestimating its significance would be a mistake. The evaluation of your work might depend on how swiftly and effectively you tackle this task. Typically, original images need conversion into formats better suited for printing or online publication. If the original image originates from a graphic editor, it might be in vector format. In this scenario, it must be rasterized and converted to a raster format for publishing purposes. You have the choice to save the image in an uncompressed format for optimal quality or convert it to a lossless compressed format to reduce file size. In certain contexts, like web publishing, you can opt for lossy compressed formats. Specially designed algorithms for image data compression permit a significant reduction in file size while preserving acceptable image quality. This facilitates fast image file downloads from the internet. In order to convert DICOM to JPEG, we'll use [Aspose.Imaging for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.imaging) package manager, search for
 **Aspose.Imaging** and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

Developers can easily load & convert DICOM files to JPEG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ load DICOM file with Image.Load method;
+ create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.);
+ call the Image.Save method;
+ pass file path with JPEG extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class.

DICOM is the acronym for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine and pertains to the field of Medical Informatics. DICOM is the combination of file format definition and a network communications protocol. DICOM uses the .DCM extension. .DCM exist in two different formats i.e. format 1.x and format 2.x. DCM Format 1.x is further available in two versions normal and extended. DICOM is used for the integration of medical imaging devices like printers, servers, scanners etc from various vendors and also contains identification data of each patient for uniqueness. DICOM files can be shared between two parties if they are capable of receiving image data in DICOM format. The communication part of DICOM is application layer protocol and uses TCP/IP to communicate between entities. HTTP and HTTPS protocols are used for the web services of DICOM. Versions supported by web services are 1.0, 1.1, 2 or later.

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image. The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality.
