In order to convert TIFF to GIF, we’ll use
[Aspose.Imaging for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.imaging) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.Imaging** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

Developers can easily load & convert TIFF files to GIF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Load TIFF file with Image.Load method
+ Create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.)
+ Call the Image.Save method
+ Pass file path with GIF extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class

TIFF or TIF, Tagged Image File Format, represents raster images that are meant for usage on a variety of devices that comply with this file format standard. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is extensible and has underwent several revisions that allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or special-purpose information. The format is not machine dependent and is free from bounds like processor, operating system, or file systems.

A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image. In contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and compatible for the graphics that consume solid areas of colour. An animated GIF combines numerous images or frames into a single file and displays them in a sequence to generate an animated clip or a short video. The colour limitations are up to 256 for each frame and are likely to be the least suitable for reproducing other images and photographs with colour gradient.
