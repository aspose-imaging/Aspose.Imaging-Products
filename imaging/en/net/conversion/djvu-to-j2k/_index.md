In order to convert DJVU to J2K, we’ll use
[Aspose.Imaging for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.imaging) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.Imaging** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

Developers can easily load & convert DJVU files to J2K in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Load DJVU file with Image.Load method
+ Create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.)
+ Call the Image.Save method
+ Pass file path with J2K extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class

DjVu, pronounced as “déjà vu”, is a graphics file format intended for scanned documents and books especially those which contain the combination of text, drawings, images and photographs. It was developed by AT&T Labs. It uses multiple techniques like image layer separation of text and background images, progressive loading, arithmetic coding and lossy compression for bitonal images. Since DJVU file can contain compressed yet high-quality colour images, photographs, text, and drawings and can be saved in less space therefore, it's used on web as eBooks, manuals, newspapers, ancient documents, etc.

A J2K file is an image that is compressed using the wavelet compression instead of DCT compression.
