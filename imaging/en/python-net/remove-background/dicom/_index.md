{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="How to Remove Background of DICOM Images and Photos with Python" %}}

To remove the background from an image or photo demands precise identification of prominent objects. For DICOM images, various methods are available for object definition. In straightforward scenarios, the automated approach efficiently handles images with uniform backgrounds. Nevertheless, when dealing with photos featuring multiple figures or objects merging with the background, it's recommended to conduct a preliminary object designation. This entails manually outlining rectangular areas and specifying the object types to be highlighted. In more intricate cases of automated object allocation, the Cloud API stands as an alternative. This cloud-based application identifies objects within a photo and employs the resulting contours to eliminate the background. Following the background removal, enhancing the edges of the remaining objects can significantly enhance the overall image quality. For removing the background in DICOM files, the suggestion is to utilize the [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Imaging for Python API" %}}


Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

DICOM is the acronym for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine and pertains to the field of Medical Informatics. DICOM is the combination of file format definition and a network communications protocol. DICOM uses the .DCM extension. .DCM exist in two different formats i.e. format 1.x and format 2.x. DCM Format 1.x is further available in two versions normal and extended. DICOM is used for the integration of medical imaging devices like printers, servers, scanners etc from various vendors and also contains identification data of each patient for uniqueness. DICOM files can be shared between two parties if they are capable of receiving image data in DICOM format. The communication part of DICOM is application layer protocol and uses TCP/IP to communicate between entities. HTTP and HTTPS protocols are used for the web services of DICOM. Versions supported by web services are 1.0, 1.1, 2 or later.
