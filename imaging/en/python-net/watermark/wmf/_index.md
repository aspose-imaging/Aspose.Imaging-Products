Incorporating a watermark is an excellent means for an author to enhance the visibility of their brand across of the Internet space. When applied to an image, a watermark not only functions as an identifier for the source or copyright holder but also stands as a effective promotional instrument for the author or online platform. This is because the watermark, whether it's the author's name or a distinctive logo, will be scattered alongside every digital iteration of the image. Watermark options include text in a variety of fonts around the periphery of the image. A semi-transparent logo won't hinder the visual appreciation of the image or photo. Should the author or copyright holder deem it crucial to emphasize their name, the watermark might partially overlay the image. To add a watermark into WMF images, we'll utilize [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

You need the [aspose-imaging-python-net](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-imaging-python-net/) to try the following workflow in your own environment.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ load WMF file with Image.Load method;
+ create instance of Graphics from the Image;
+ define Font, Brush and Format for watermark text;
+ draw watermark using Graphics.DrawString method;
+ save image to disc in WMF format.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Imaging for Python API" %}}


Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

Files with WMF extension represent Microsoft Windows Metafile (WMF) for storing vector as well as bitmap-format images data. To be more accurate, WMF belongs to the vector file format category of Graphics file formats that is device independent. Windows Graphical Device Interface (GDI) uses the functions stored in a WMF file to display an image on the screen. A more enhanced version of WMF, known as Enhanced Meta Files (EMF), was published later that makes the format more feature rich. Practically, WMF are similar to SVG.
