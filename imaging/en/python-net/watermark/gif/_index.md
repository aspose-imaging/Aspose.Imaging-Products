Incorporating a watermark is an excellent means for an author to enhance the visibility of their brand across of the Internet space. When applied to an image, a watermark not only functions as an identifier for the source or copyright holder but also stands as a effective promotional instrument for the author or online platform. This is because the watermark, whether it's the author's name or a distinctive logo, will be scattered alongside every digital iteration of the image. Watermark options include text in a variety of fonts around the periphery of the image. A semi-transparent logo won't hinder the visual appreciation of the image or photo. Should the author or copyright holder deem it crucial to emphasize their name, the watermark might partially overlay the image. To add a watermark into GIF images, we'll utilize [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Imaging for Python API" %}}


Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image. In contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and compatible for the graphics that consume solid areas of colour. An animated GIF combines numerous images or frames into a single file and displays them in a sequence to generate an animated clip or a short video. The colour limitations are up to 256 for each frame and are likely to be the least suitable for reproducing other images and photographs with colour gradient.
