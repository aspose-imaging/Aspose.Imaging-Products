{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="How to Watermark ICO File Using Python" %}}

A watermark is an essential tool for authors seeking maximum exposure for their work on the internet. Placing a watermark on an image serves not only to identify its source or copyright holder but also to promote its creator. This is because the signature containing the author's name or the internet resource's name is distributed alongside a digital copy of the image. Watermarks can take the form of text with a wide range of fonts and can be positioned at the image's edge. When the watermark is transparent, it doesn't disrupt viewing. However, if the author or copyright holder wishes to emphasize their name, the watermark may partially overlap the image. In order to watermark ICO image file, we'll use [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Imaging for Python API" %}}


Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

The ICO file format is an image file format for computer icons in Microsoft Windows. ICO files contain one or more small images at multiple sizes and color depths, such that they may be scaled appropriately. In Windows, all executables that display an icon to the user, on the desktop, in the Start Menu, or in Windows Explorer, must carry the icon in ICO format.
