Often, while editing an image in CDR, the necessity arises to change its background. The initial step involves selecting foreground objects within the photo and distinguishing them from the rest of the image to isolate the areas attributed to the background. When the background constitutes a uniform area, object contours can be automatically established. However, if the photo exhibits an irregular background or complications arise in distinguishing the desired object from the backdrop, employing the preliminary image marking method is advisable. This entails selecting rectangular areas within the photo where anticipated objects are positioned and specifying their type. Such actions can be manually executed or facilitated through the Cloud API for automated object detection. Following the selection of objects and the removal of the original background, you have the option to introduce a new background or render it transparent. To modify the background of an image in CDR format, we will utilize [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Imaging for Python API" %}}


Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

A CDR file is a vector drawing image file that is natively created with CorelDRAW for storing digital image encoded and compressed. Such a drawing file contains text, lines, shapes, images, colours and effects for vector representation of image contents. CDR files can be opened with CorelDRAW as the primary application and can also be converted to other formats such as PDF, JPG, PNG, BMP and AI. It can be used for representation of various graphics data like brochures, tabloids, envelopes, and postcards. Besides CorelDRAW, other Corel products such as Corel Paintshop Pro and CorelDRAW Graphics suite can also open the CDR file formats.
