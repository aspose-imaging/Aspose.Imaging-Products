{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="How to View WMF images Using Python" %}}

We often receive images in less common formats as source materials. For subsequent viewing of such images, special programs are required. In order not to think about this problem and use the time to solve the issue for more creative tasks, use the functions of the Python graphic library. By converting such images to files of more popular formats, you can open them in the standard image viewing program for your platform. In order to view WMF files, we'll use [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

```cs
>> pip install aspose-imaging-python-net
```

You need the [aspose-imaging-python-net](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-imaging-python-net/) to try the following workflow in your own environment.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ load WMF files with Image.Load method;
+ create image view;
+ save new image to disc in the supported by Aspose.Imaging format.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Imaging for Python API" %}}


Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

Files with WMF extension represent Microsoft Windows Metafile (WMF) for storing vector as well as bitmap-format images data. To be more accurate, WMF belongs to the vector file format category of Graphics file formats that is device independent. Windows Graphical Device Interface (GDI) uses the functions stored in a WMF file to display an image on the screen. A more enhanced version of WMF, known as Enhanced Meta Files (EMF), was published later that makes the format more feature rich. Practically, WMF are similar to SVG.
