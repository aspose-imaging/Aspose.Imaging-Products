Developers can easily load & convert EMZ files to ICO in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Load EMZ file with Image.load method
+ Create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.)
+ Call the Image.save method
+ Pass file path with ICO extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class

A file with the EMZ file extension is a compressed image file, more specifically referred to as a Windows Compressed Enhanced Metafile file

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="ICO" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/ico/" whatIsFormat1="What is" whatIsFormat2="File Format" readMoreFormat="Read More">}}
The ICO file format is an image file format for computer icons in Microsoft Windows. ICO files contain one or more small images at multiple sizes and color depths, such that they may be scaled appropriately. In Windows, all executables that display an icon to the user, on the desktop, in the Start Menu, or in Windows Explorer, must carry the icon in ICO format.
