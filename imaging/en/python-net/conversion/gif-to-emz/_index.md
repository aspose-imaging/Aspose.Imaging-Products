Image files conversion from one format to another is a common task encountered by every graphic designer. The efficiency and excellence in converting files not only impact the speed of completion but also play a crucial role in assessing the overall work quality. Concerning the images sources, they frequently necessitate transformation into alternative formats more suited for printing or online distribution. An image crafted in a graphic editor is likely to be in vector format. In such instances, for website publication, it must undergo rasterization and be saved in a raster format. You have the option to convert the image in an uncompressed format for superior quality or save it to a lossless compressed format to minimize the file size. For scenarios where file size reduction is obligatory, like in website applications, there's the possibility of conversion to lossy compression formats. Specialized data compression algorithms for images can significantly diminish file size while upholding acceptable image quality, ensuring swift image loading. To convert images and photos from GIF to EMZ, we will employ [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

Developers can easily load & convert GIF files to EMZ in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ load GIF file with Image.Load method;
+ create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.);
+ call the Image.Save method;
+ pass file path with EMZ extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class.

A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image. In contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and compatible for the graphics that consume solid areas of colour. An animated GIF combines numerous images or frames into a single file and displays them in a sequence to generate an animated clip or a short video. The colour limitations are up to 256 for each frame and are likely to be the least suitable for reproducing other images and photographs with colour gradient.

A file with the EMZ file extension is a compressed image file, more specifically referred to as a Windows Compressed Enhanced Metafile file
