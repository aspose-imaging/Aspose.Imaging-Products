Image files conversion from one format to another is a common task encountered by every graphic designer. The efficiency and excellence in converting files not only impact the speed of completion but also play a crucial role in assessing the overall work quality. Concerning the images sources, they frequently necessitate transformation into alternative formats more suited for printing or online distribution. An image crafted in a graphic editor is likely to be in vector format. In such instances, for website publication, it must undergo rasterization and be saved in a raster format. You have the option to convert the image in an uncompressed format for superior quality or save it to a lossless compressed format to minimize the file size. For scenarios where file size reduction is obligatory, like in website applications, there's the possibility of conversion to lossy compression formats. Specialized data compression algorithms for images can significantly diminish file size while upholding acceptable image quality, ensuring swift image loading. To convert images and photos from DIB to WEBP, we will employ [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

Developers can easily load & convert DIB files to WEBP in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ load DIB file with Image.Load method;
+ create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.);
+ call the Image.Save method;
+ pass file path with WEBP extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class.

A DIB (Device Independent Bitmap) file is a raster image file that is similar in structure to the standard Bitmap files (BMP) but has a different header. It can be opened with almost all applications that can open a standard BMP file on Windows as well as macOS. DIB are binary files and have a complex file format similar to BMP.

WebP, introduced by Google, is a modern raster web image file format that is based on lossless and lossy compression. It provides same image quality while considerably reducing the image size. Since most of the web pages use images as effective representation of data, the use of WebP images in web pages results in faster loading of web pages. As per Google, WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs, while WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller than comparable JPEG images. Images are compared based on the Structural Similarity (SSIM) index between WebP and other image file formats. WebP is a sister project of WebM multimedia container format.
