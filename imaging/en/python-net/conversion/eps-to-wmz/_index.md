Image files conversion from one format to another is a common task encountered by every graphic designer. The efficiency and excellence in converting files not only impact the speed of completion but also play a crucial role in assessing the overall work quality. Concerning the images sources, they frequently necessitate transformation into alternative formats more suited for printing or online distribution. An image crafted in a graphic editor is likely to be in vector format. In such instances, for website publication, it must undergo rasterization and be saved in a raster format. You have the option to convert the image in an uncompressed format for superior quality or save it to a lossless compressed format to minimize the file size. For scenarios where file size reduction is obligatory, like in website applications, there's the possibility of conversion to lossy compression formats. Specialized data compression algorithms for images can significantly diminish file size while upholding acceptable image quality, ensuring swift image loading. To convert images and photos from EPS to WMZ, we will employ [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

Developers can easily load & convert EPS files to WMZ in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ load EPS file with Image.Load method;
+ create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.);
+ call the Image.Save method;
+ pass file path with WMZ extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class.

FIles with EPS extension essentially describe an Encapsulated PostScript language program that describes the appearance of a single page. The name "Encapsulated" because it can be included or encapsulated in another PostScript language page description. This script based file format may contain any combination of text, graphics and images. EPS files may include a bitmap preview image encapsulated inside for display by applications that can open such files. EPS files can be converted to standard image formats such as JPG, PNG, TIFF and PDF using different applications e.g. Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and PaintShop Pro. Because of a security vulnerability in EPS files, Office 2016, Office 2013, Office 2010, and Office 365 have turned off the ability to insert EPS files into Office documents.

WMZ is a file extension for a skin file format in/for/used by Windows Media Player. A WMZ file is basically a zipped WMF file in XML.
