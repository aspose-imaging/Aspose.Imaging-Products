Converting file formats may seem like a routine task encountered by graphic designers. Yet, underestimating its significance would be a mistake. The evaluation of your work might depend on how swiftly and effectively you tackle this task. Typically, original images need conversion into formats better suited for printing or online publication. If the original image originates from a graphic editor, it might be in vector format. In this scenario, it must be rasterized and converted to a raster format for publishing purposes. You have the choice to save the image in an uncompressed format for optimal quality or convert it to a lossless compressed format to reduce file size. In certain contexts, like web publishing, you can opt for lossy compressed formats. Specially designed algorithms for image data compression permit a significant reduction in file size while preserving acceptable image quality. This facilitates fast image file downloads from the internet. In order to convert JPEG to BMP, we'll use [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

Developers can easily load & convert JPEG files to BMP in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Load JPEG file with Image.load method
+ Create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.)
+ Call the Image.save method
+ Pass file path with BMP extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image. The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality.

Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
