{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

Developers can easily load & convert EMF files to J2K in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Load EMF file with Image.load method
+ Create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.)
+ Call the Image.save method
+ Pass file path with J2K extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class

Enhanced metafile format (EMF) stores graphical images device-independently. Metafiles of EMF comprises of variable-length records in chronological order that can render the stored image after parsing on any output device. These variable-length records can be definitions of enclosed objects, commands for drawing, and graphics properties critical to render the image accurately. When a device opens an EMF metafile using its own graphics environment, the proportions, dimensions, colors and other graphic properties of original image remains same regardless of the opening device platform.

A J2K file is an image that is compressed using the wavelet compression instead of DCT compression.
