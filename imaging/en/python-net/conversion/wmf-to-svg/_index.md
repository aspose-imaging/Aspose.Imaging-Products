Image files conversion from one format to another is a common task encountered by every graphic designer. The efficiency and excellence in converting files not only impact the speed of completion but also play a crucial role in assessing the overall work quality. Concerning the images sources, they frequently necessitate transformation into alternative formats more suited for printing or online distribution. An image crafted in a graphic editor is likely to be in vector format. In such instances, for website publication, it must undergo rasterization and be saved in a raster format. You have the option to convert the image in an uncompressed format for superior quality or save it to a lossless compressed format to minimize the file size. For scenarios where file size reduction is obligatory, like in website applications, there's the possibility of conversion to lossy compression formats. Specialized data compression algorithms for images can significantly diminish file size while upholding acceptable image quality, ensuring swift image loading. To convert images and photos from WMF to SVG, we will employ [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

Developers can easily load & convert WMF files to SVG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ load WMF file with Image.Load method;
+ create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.);
+ call the Image.Save method;
+ pass file path with SVG extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class.

Files with WMF extension represent Microsoft Windows Metafile (WMF) for storing vector as well as bitmap-format images data. To be more accurate, WMF belongs to the vector file format category of Graphics file formats that is device independent. Windows Graphical Device Interface (GDI) uses the functions stored in a WMF file to display an image on the screen. A more enhanced version of WMF, known as Enhanced Meta Files (EMF), was published later that makes the format more feature rich. Practically, WMF are similar to SVG.

SVG files are Scalable Vector Graphics Files that use XML based text format for describing the appearance of image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that the SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. Text based description of such files make them independent of resolution. It is one of the mostly used format for building website and print graphics in order to achieve scalability. The format can only be used for two-dimensional graphics though. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.
