{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

Developers can easily load & convert J2K files to EMZ in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Load J2K file with Image.load method
+ Create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.)
+ Call the Image.save method
+ Pass file path with EMZ extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class
