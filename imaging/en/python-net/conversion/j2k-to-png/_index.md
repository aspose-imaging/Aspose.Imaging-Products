Image files conversion from one format to another is a common task encountered by every graphic designer. The efficiency and excellence in converting files not only impact the speed of completion but also play a crucial role in assessing the overall work quality. Concerning the images sources, they frequently necessitate transformation into alternative formats more suited for printing or online distribution. An image crafted in a graphic editor is likely to be in vector format. In such instances, for website publication, it must undergo rasterization and be saved in a raster format. You have the option to convert the image in an uncompressed format for superior quality or save it to a lossless compressed format to minimize the file size. For scenarios where file size reduction is obligatory, like in website applications, there's the possibility of conversion to lossy compression formats. Specialized data compression algorithms for images can significantly diminish file size while upholding acceptable image quality, ensuring swift image loading. To convert images and photos from J2K to PNG, we will employ [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

Developers can easily load & convert J2K files to PNG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ load J2K file with Image.Load method;
+ create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.);
+ call the Image.Save method;
+ pass file path with PNG extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class.

A J2K file is an image that is compressed using the wavelet compression instead of DCT compression.

PNG, Portable Network Graphics, refers to a type of raster image file format that use loseless compression. This file format was created as a replacement of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports loseless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved as one of the mostly used image file format. Almost all Operating Systems have support for opening PNG files. For example, Microsoft Windows viewer has the capability to open PNG files as the OS has by default the support available as part of installation.
