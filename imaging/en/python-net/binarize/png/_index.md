The invention of color film marked a significant milestone in the realm of photography. However, classical photography is inherently linked to black and white imagery. Despite the extensive technical capabilities of cameras to capture the full spectrum of colors, many individuals opt for monochrome, transforming their pictures into black and white. In such instances, a binarization function comes into play, converting all pixels into binary values: \"0\" for white and \"1\" for black. In other scenarios, this conversion isn't driven by artistic choices but practical ones, like preparing black and white illustrations for printing in books or newspapers. Using the Python graphics library, you can designate a pixel brightness threshold. Pixels with brightness values below this threshold will become black, while those above it will become white. Alternatively, you can employ an adaptive binarization method that considers the pixel values in the surrounding area. This approach results in smoother transitions between color boundaries in the resulting black and white image. In order to Binarize PNG files, we'll use [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

You need the [aspose-imaging-python-net](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-imaging-python-net/) to try the following workflow in your own environment.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ load PNG files with Image.Load method;
+ binarize image;
+ save binarized image to disc in the supported by Aspose.Imaging format.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Imaging for Python API" %}}


Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

PNG, Portable Network Graphics, refers to a type of raster image file format that use loseless compression. This file format was created as a replacement of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports loseless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved as one of the mostly used image file format. Almost all Operating Systems have support for opening PNG files. For example, Microsoft Windows viewer has the capability to open PNG files as the OS has by default the support available as part of installation.
