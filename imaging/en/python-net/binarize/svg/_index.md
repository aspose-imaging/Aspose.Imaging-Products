The introduction of color photography marked a pivotal shift in the photographic sphere.  Nevertheless, the allure of the classic black and white image still persists. In spite of the prevalence of color cameras, many individuals still opt to convert their photographs into black and white. This transformation is typically achieved through a binarization process, replacing each pixel with a binary value: "0" for white and "1" for black. Black and white images are often used for more than just artistic purposes, finding practical application in scenarios such as printing illustrations in publications like books and newspapers. Within the Python graphics library, you have the ability to set a pixel brightness threshold. Pixels below this threshold assume a black color, while those above it adopt a white color. An adaptive binarization technique is also available, considering the surrounding pixel values to create seamless transitions between color boundaries in the resultant black and white image. For binarizing SVG files, we will utilize [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Imaging for Python API" %}}


Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

SVG files are Scalable Vector Graphics Files that use XML based text format for describing the appearance of image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that the SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. Text based description of such files make them independent of resolution. It is one of the mostly used format for building website and print graphics in order to achieve scalability. The format can only be used for two-dimensional graphics though. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.
