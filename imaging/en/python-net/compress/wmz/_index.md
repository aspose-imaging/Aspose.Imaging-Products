Preparing images for publication involves both creative and technical aspects, including file compression. While high-resolution images are crucial for print or outdoor advertising, they might reduce web performance due to their large file size. The appropriate image compression technique varies depending on the purpose and publishing platform. Large files can slow down loading times, particularly on mobile connections, leading to a poor user experience. Users might abandon a site that takes too long to load and seek a faster alternative. Conversely, excessive image compression can result in blurriness and pixelation, degrading the viewing experience. The right choice of compression algorithms and ratios is essential to strike a balance between file size and image quality. In order to compress WMZ files, we'll use [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Imaging for Python API" %}}


Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.
