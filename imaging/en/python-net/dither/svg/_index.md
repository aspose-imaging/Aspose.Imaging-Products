Enhancing image and photo parameters for a website significantly impacts web traffic. Among these optimizations, reducing an image's color palette effectively minimizes file sizes and accelerates page loading. Yet, to prevent abrupt edges or disturbances in color gradients, leveraging the dithering method is recommended. This technique aids in refining color transitions and enhancing overall image quality. It introduces a slight "noise" that positively influences image perception. For dither images in the SVG format, we'll apply [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

+ load SVG files with Image.Load method;
+ dither image;
+ save dithered image to disc in the supported by Aspose.Imaging format.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Imaging for Python API" %}}


Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

SVG files are Scalable Vector Graphics Files that use XML based text format for describing the appearance of image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that the SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. Text based description of such files make them independent of resolution. It is one of the mostly used format for building website and print graphics in order to achieve scalability. The format can only be used for two-dimensional graphics though. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.
