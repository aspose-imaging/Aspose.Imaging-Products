Enhancing image and photo parameters for a website significantly impacts web traffic. Among these optimizations, reducing an image's color palette effectively minimizes file sizes and accelerates page loading. Yet, to prevent abrupt edges or disturbances in color gradients, leveraging the dithering method is recommended. This technique aids in refining color transitions and enhancing overall image quality. It introduces a slight "noise" that positively influences image perception. For dither images in the TIFF format, we'll apply [Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET](/imaging/en/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. You may install it using the following command from your system command.

+ load TIFF files with Image.Load method;
+ dither image;
+ save dithered image to disc in the supported by Aspose.Imaging format.

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.Imaging for Python API" %}}


Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

TIFF or TIF, Tagged Image File Format, represents raster images that are meant for usage on a variety of devices that comply with this file format standard. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is extensible and has underwent several revisions that allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or special-purpose information. The format is not machine dependent and is free from bounds like processor, operating system, or file systems.
