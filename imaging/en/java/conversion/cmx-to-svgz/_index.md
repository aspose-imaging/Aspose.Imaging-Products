In order to convert CMX to SVGZ, we’ll use [Aspose.Imaging for Java](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/java) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-imaging) and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

Developers can easily load & convert CMX files to SVGZ in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Load CMX file with Image.load method
+ Create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.)
+ Call the Image.save method
+ Pass file path with SVGZ extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class

Files with CMX extension are Corel Exchange image file format that is used as presentation by CorelSuite applications. It contains image data as vector graphics as well as metadata that describes the image. CMX files can be opened by CorelDraw, Corel Presentations, Paint Shop Pro and some versions of Adobe Illustrator.

A file with .svgz extension is a compressed version of Scalable Vector Graphics (.SVG) file. It is compressed with gzip compression and contains data in XML format. SVGZ files support transparency, gradients, animations, and filters. SVGZ files are smaller in size as compared to the default SVG files and this reduced file size helps transfer the graphics files online. Graphics designer create SVGZ files using tools like Adobe Illustrator, Corel PaintShop Pro, and others. However, SVGZ files can be generated by enabling GZip compression in the Apache Server while sending out the image data.
