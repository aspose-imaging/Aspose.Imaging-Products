In order to convert DNG to EMZ, we’ll use
[Aspose.Imaging for Java](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/java) 
API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
[Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-imaging) 
and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

Developers can easily load & convert DNG files to EMZ in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Load DNG file with Image.load method
+ Create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.)
+ Call the Image.save method
+ Pass file path with EMZ extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class

DNG is a digital camera image format used for the storage of raw files. It has been developed by Adobe in September 2004. It was basically developed for digital photography. DNG is an extension of TIFF/EP standard format and uses metadata significantly. In order to manipulate raw data from digital cameras with ease of flexibility and artistic control, photographers opt camera raw files. JPEG and TIFF formats store images that are processed by the camera, therefore not much room for alteration is available in such formats.

A file with the EMZ file extension is a compressed image file, more specifically referred to as a Windows Compressed Enhanced Metafile file
