Converting file formats may seem like a routine task encountered by graphic designers. Yet, underestimating its significance would be a mistake. The evaluation of your work might depend on how swiftly and effectively you tackle this task. Typically, original images need conversion into formats better suited for printing or online publication. If the original image originates from a graphic editor, it might be in vector format. In this scenario, it must be rasterized and converted to a raster format for publishing purposes. You have the choice to save the image in an uncompressed format for optimal quality or convert it to a lossless compressed format to reduce file size. In certain contexts, like web publishing, you can opt for lossy compressed formats. Specially designed algorithms for image data compression permit a significant reduction in file size while preserving acceptable image quality. This facilitates fast image file downloads from the internet. In order to convert ICO to PNG, we'll use [Aspose.Imaging for Java](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/java) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-imaging) and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

Developers can easily load & convert ICO files to PNG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Load ICO file with Image.load method
+ Create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.)
+ Call the Image.save method
+ Pass file path with PNG extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class

The ICO file format is an image file format for computer icons in Microsoft Windows. ICO files contain one or more small images at multiple sizes and color depths, such that they may be scaled appropriately. In Windows, all executables that display an icon to the user, on the desktop, in the Start Menu, or in Windows Explorer, must carry the icon in ICO format.

PNG, Portable Network Graphics, refers to a type of raster image file format that use loseless compression. This file format was created as a replacement of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports loseless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved as one of the mostly used image file format. Almost all Operating Systems have support for opening PNG files. For example, Microsoft Windows viewer has the capability to open PNG files as the OS has by default the support available as part of installation.
