In order to convert TIF to DICOM, we’ll use [Aspose.Imaging for Java](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/java) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-imaging) and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

Developers can easily load & convert TIF files to DICOM in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Load TIF file with Image.load method
+ Create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.)
+ Call the Image.save method
+ Pass file path with DICOM extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class

DICOM is the acronym for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine and pertains to the field of Medical Informatics. DICOM is the combination of file format definition and a network communications protocol. DICOM uses the .DCM extension. .DCM exist in two different formats i.e. format 1.x and format 2.x. DCM Format 1.x is further available in two versions normal and extended. DICOM is used for the integration of medical imaging devices like printers, servers, scanners etc from various vendors and also contains identification data of each patient for uniqueness. DICOM files can be shared between two parties if they are capable of receiving image data in DICOM format. The communication part of DICOM is application layer protocol and uses TCP/IP to communicate between entities. HTTP and HTTPS protocols are used for the web services of DICOM. Versions supported by web services are 1.0, 1.1, 2 or later.
