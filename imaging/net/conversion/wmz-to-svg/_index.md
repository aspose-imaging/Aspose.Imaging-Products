A file with .wmz extension is a compressed version of WMF and is used to store metafiles. It is an intermediate level file generated by older versions of Microsoft Office applications and is not very popularly used. WMZ files are generated while saving documents to HTML format. These may also be generated while emailing documents that contain embedded clip art, equations, etc. Applications that can open WMZ files include (but not limited to) Corel Winzip and Apple Archive Utility.

SVG files are Scalable Vector Graphics Files that use XML based text format for describing the appearance of image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that the SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. Text based description of such files make them independent of resolution. It is one of the mostly used format for building website and print graphics in order to achieve scalability. The format can only be used for two-dimensional graphics though. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.
