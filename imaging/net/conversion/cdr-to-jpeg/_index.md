In order to convert CDR to JPEG, we’ll use
[Aspose.Imaging for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.imaging) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.Imaging** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

Developers can easily load & convert CDR files to JPEG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+ Load CDR file with Image.Load method
+ Create & set the instance of required subclass of ImageOptionsBase (e.g. BmpOptions, PngOptions, etc.)
+ Call the Image.Save method
+ Pass file path with JPEG extension & object of ImageOptionsBase class

Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

A CDR file is a vector drawing image file that is natively created with CorelDRAW for storing digital image encoded and compressed. Such a drawing file contains text, lines, shapes, images, colours and effects for vector representation of image contents. CDR files can be opened with CorelDRAW as the primary application and can also be converted to other formats such as PDF, JPG, PNG, BMP and AI. It can be used for representation of various graphics data like brochures, tabloids, envelopes, and postcards. Besides CorelDRAW, other Corel products such as Corel Paintshop Pro and CorelDRAW Graphics suite can also open the CDR file formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JPEG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg" >}}
A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image. The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality.
