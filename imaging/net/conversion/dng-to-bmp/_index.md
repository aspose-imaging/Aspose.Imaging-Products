 A cross-platform Imaging Library capable of processing the most common image formats along with DjVu, DICOM, WebP & DNG. The API can create, load, manipulate, convert & compress images as well as can transform images, perform filtering, dithering, masking and de-skewing. All with various memory optimization strategies.

DNG is a digital camera image format used for the storage of raw files. It has been developed by Adobe in September 2004. It was basically developed for digital photography. DNG is an extension of TIFF/EP standard format and uses metadata significantly. In order to manipulate raw data from digital cameras with ease of flexibility and artistic control, photographers opt camera raw files. JPEG and TIFF formats store images that are processed by the camera, therefore not much room for alteration is available in such formats.

Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
