 Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images with in applications. Aspose.Imaging is a fast API for Image processing, including but not limited to image conversions and manipulations such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, image transformations, export and conversion to multiple formats. Its a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high performance image conversion feature with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on premise APIs and files are processed at your own servers.

```cs

// load an existing EPS with Image.Load
using (var image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Load("template.eps"))
{
    // create and initialize an instance of Graphics class and Initialize an object of SizeF to store image Size
    var graphics = new Aspose.Imaging.Graphics(image);
    var size = graphics.Image.Size;

    // create an instance of Font. Initialize it with Font Face, Size and Style
    var font = new Aspose.Imaging.Font("Times New Roman", 20, Aspose.Imaging.FontStyle.Bold);

    // create an instance of SolidBrush and set Color & Opacity
    var brush = new Aspose.Imaging.Brushes.SolidBrush();
    brush.Color = Aspose.Imaging.Color.Red;
    brush.Opacity = 0;

    // initialize an object of StringFormat class and set its various properties
    var format = new Aspose.Imaging.StringFormat();
    format.Alignment = Aspose.Imaging.StringAlignment.Center;
    format.FormatFlags = Aspose.Imaging.StringFormatFlags.MeasureTrailingSpaces;

    // draw the string on image 
    graphics.DrawString("CONFIDENTIAL", font, brush, 0, 0, format);

    // save output to disc
    image.Save("output.eps");

FIles with EPS extension essentially describe an Encapsulated PostScript language program that describes the appearance of a single page. The name "Encapsulated" because it can be included or encapsulated in another PostScript language page description. This script based file format may contain any combination of text, graphics and images. EPS files may include a bitmap preview image encapsulated inside for display by applications that can open such files. EPS files can be converted to standard image formats such as JPG, PNG, TIFF and PDF using different applications e.g. Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and PaintShop Pro. Because of a security vulnerability in EPS files, Office 2016, Office 2013, Office 2010, and Office 365 have turned off the ability to insert EPS files into Office documents.
