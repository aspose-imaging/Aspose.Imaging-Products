 Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images with in applications. Aspose.Imaging is a fast API for Image processing, including but not limited to image conversions and manipulations such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, image transformations, export and conversion to multiple formats. Its a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high performance image conversion feature with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on premise APIs and files are processed at your own servers.

```cs

// load an existing J2K with Image.Load
using (var image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Load("template.j2k"))
{
    // create and initialize an instance of Graphics class and Initialize an object of SizeF to store image Size
    var graphics = new Aspose.Imaging.Graphics(image);
    var size = graphics.Image.Size;

    // create an instance of Font. Initialize it with Font Face, Size and Style
    var font = new Aspose.Imaging.Font("Times New Roman", 20, Aspose.Imaging.FontStyle.Bold);

    // create an instance of SolidBrush and set Color & Opacity
    var brush = new Aspose.Imaging.Brushes.SolidBrush();
    brush.Color = Aspose.Imaging.Color.Red;
    brush.Opacity = 0;

    // initialize an object of StringFormat class and set its various properties
    var format = new Aspose.Imaging.StringFormat();
    format.Alignment = Aspose.Imaging.StringAlignment.Center;
    format.FormatFlags = Aspose.Imaging.StringFormatFlags.MeasureTrailingSpaces;

    // draw the string on image 
    graphics.DrawString("CONFIDENTIAL", font, brush, 0, 0, format);

    // save output to disc
    image.Save("output.j2k");

A J2K file is an image that is compressed using the wavelet compression instead of DCT compression. This file format is used by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) 2000 files. J2K files store metadata information about the image file in XML unlike .jpeg or .jpg that use the EXIF format for this purpose. J2K files support 15-bit color, alpha transparency, and lossless compression. Several commercial APIs exist to decode JPEG 2000 imags such as J2K-Codec. A J2K file can be opened on Windows OS using the standard image viewers.
