 Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images with in applications. Aspose.Imaging is a fast API for Image processing, including but not limited to image conversions and manipulations such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, image transformations, export and conversion to multiple formats. Its a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high performance image conversion feature with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on premise APIs and files are processed at your own servers.

```cs

// load an existing JP2 with Image.Load
using (var image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Load("template.jp2"))
{
    // create and initialize an instance of Graphics class and Initialize an object of SizeF to store image Size
    var graphics = new Aspose.Imaging.Graphics(image);
    var size = graphics.Image.Size;

    // create an instance of Font. Initialize it with Font Face, Size and Style
    var font = new Aspose.Imaging.Font("Times New Roman", 20, Aspose.Imaging.FontStyle.Bold);

    // create an instance of SolidBrush and set Color & Opacity
    var brush = new Aspose.Imaging.Brushes.SolidBrush();
    brush.Color = Aspose.Imaging.Color.Red;
    brush.Opacity = 0;

    // initialize an object of StringFormat class and set its various properties
    var format = new Aspose.Imaging.StringFormat();
    format.Alignment = Aspose.Imaging.StringAlignment.Center;
    format.FormatFlags = Aspose.Imaging.StringFormatFlags.MeasureTrailingSpaces;

    // draw the string on image 
    graphics.DrawString("CONFIDENTIAL", font, brush, 0, 0, format);

    // save output to disc
    image.Save("output.jp2");

JPEG 2000 (JP2) is an image coding system and state-of-the-art image compression standard. Designed, using wavelet technology JPEG 2000 can code lossless content in any quality at once. Moreover, without any substantial penalty in coding efficiency, JPEG 2000  have the capability to access and decode the same content efficaciously into a variety of other resolutions and qualities. The code streams in JPEG 2000 is significantly scalable having regions of interest that provide the facility for spatial random access. Possessing Up to 16384 diverse components with the dimensions in terapixels, and precision that can be high as 38 bits/sample.
