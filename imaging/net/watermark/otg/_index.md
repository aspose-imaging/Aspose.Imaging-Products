 Aspose.Imaging API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images with in applications. Aspose.Imaging is a fast API for Image processing, including but not limited to image conversions and manipulations such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, image transformations, export and conversion to multiple formats. Its a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high performance image conversion feature with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on premise APIs and files are processed at your own servers.

```cs

// load an existing OTG with Image.Load
using (var image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Load("template.otg"))
{
    // create and initialize an instance of Graphics class and Initialize an object of SizeF to store image Size
    var graphics = new Aspose.Imaging.Graphics(image);
    var size = graphics.Image.Size;

    // create an instance of Font. Initialize it with Font Face, Size and Style
    var font = new Aspose.Imaging.Font("Times New Roman", 20, Aspose.Imaging.FontStyle.Bold);

    // create an instance of SolidBrush and set Color & Opacity
    var brush = new Aspose.Imaging.Brushes.SolidBrush();
    brush.Color = Aspose.Imaging.Color.Red;
    brush.Opacity = 0;

    // initialize an object of StringFormat class and set its various properties
    var format = new Aspose.Imaging.StringFormat();
    format.Alignment = Aspose.Imaging.StringAlignment.Center;
    format.FormatFlags = Aspose.Imaging.StringFormatFlags.MeasureTrailingSpaces;

    // draw the string on image 
    graphics.DrawString("CONFIDENTIAL", font, brush, 0, 0, format);

    // save output to disc
    image.Save("output.otg");
